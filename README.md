## About The Project

Static application security testing (SAST) software inspects and analyzes an applicationâ€™s code to discover security vulnerabilities without actually executing code.  SAST tools provide vulnerability information and remediation suggestions for development teams to resolve. There is relation and overlap between SAST tools and software, but SAST products are more focused on security testing. Static code analysis products, on the other hand, combine a number of analytical practices, test management, and team collaboration features.

Here's why:
* Create your own rules on yours framework
* Run in all language depends on your rules
